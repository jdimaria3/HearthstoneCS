      <h1 style="font-size:30px; text-align:center;">The Problem</h1>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">The Hearthstone Card Searcher project was brainstormed as a way to make it easier for players to make new decks. We enjoy playing Hearthstone and coming up with new and custom decks - however, we believe the in game searching tool, while effective, is hard to utilize depending on the device you play on. Many of its players play on either a phone or tablet, and thus the screen size to search and evaluate cards for decks is small, and this hinders player's abilities to efficiently look for new cards. And anyone who plays a card game knows: all aspects of cards, be it their cost, abilities, attack/health, class, or type, are equally important.</p>

      <h1 style="font-size:30px; text-align:center;">The Solution</h1>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">We developed a tool you can access on your computer and phone (but ideally on your computer) that allows you to search through a database of every card available in Hearthstone. We added in search parameters for all aspects that we believe may be important in the creation of a new deck. We allow users to search via all of the following: Type, Class, Rarity, Cost, Attack, and Health. In addition, we also allow users to search via a standard text search. We believe that all of these give players the ability to find exactly the types of cards they need for any kind of deck they want to make.</p>

  <p style="text-align:center;">Looking to create a deck that allows you to fill the board quickly with low cost minions, swarming your opponent early on? Select "Minion" as Type and set the slider for cost to be in the 0-3 range. Looking to create a Mage deck filled with spells that constantly counter anything your opponent does? Select "Spell" as Type and "Mage" as Class to see every card you could possibly want. Looking to create a deck filled with Legendary minions to flex on all your friends and random F2P opponents? Select "Legendary" as Rarity and search away. With our tool, we allow users to quickly and efficiently search for cards to perfectly suit their deck's needs. No more squinting at a tiny phone display: now, see the cards displayed prominently and clearly in your browser. This is a companion tool built by Hearthstone players, for Hearthstone players.</p>
