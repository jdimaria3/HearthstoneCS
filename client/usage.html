    <div id="left">
      <p style="text-align:justify;">There are two main ways of searching with our tool. The first is by applying filters to the cards. By using the radio buttons shown, you can filter out cards depending on their Card Type, Class, and Rarity. These radio buttons have an option to select “All” for each category.
      <br> <br>
      You can also see sliders below these categories. Each group of sliders can be used to specify the numerical range of things like cost for spells, and cost, attack, and health for minions. When searching for spells, “Attack” and “Health” are not considered.

  <div id="parent">
    <div id="left">
      <p style="text-align:justify;">Once all the filters have been applied, you can press the green “FILTER” button found to the right of the screen to begin the search. Depending on how many cards are being retrieved, the retrieval may take a few moments. Below is an example of the cards that may show up given the filters applied in the example above (Spells from every class with Epic rarity, with a cost of greater than 4).
      <br> <br>
      The grey button “RESET” button can be used to reset all the filters and sliders to their original positions.

  <div id="parent">
    <div id="left">
      <p style="text-align:justify;">When more than 10 cards are retrieved from the search, you can navigate between all of them using the “PREV” and “NEXT” buttons found above the card display area. When only face down cards are displayed, you have reached the end of the retrieved cards.

  <div id="parent">
    <div id="left">
      <p style="text-align:justify;">The second way of searching is by card name. To search in this manner, type a name into the text field next to the purple “SEARCH” button, and then press the “SEARCH” button. This type of searching is independent and separate from the filters, and as such the filters will not apply to the new cards displayed. Below is an example of the results of searching for “knight” through the search by name functionality. <b> PLEASE NOTE: This text search does not currently support regex.</b>
