# Hearthstone Card Searcher Tool

**Overview**

The Hearthstone Card Searcher project was brainstormed as a way to make it easier for players to make new decks. We enjoy playing Hearthstone and coming up with new and custom decks - however, we believe the in game searching tool, while effective, is hard to utilize depending on the device you play on. Many of its players play on either a phone or tablet, and thus the screen size to search and evaluate cards for decks is small, and this hinders player's abilities to efficiently look for new cards. And anyone who plays a card game knows: all aspects of cards, be it their cost, abilities, attack/health, class, or type, are equally important.
